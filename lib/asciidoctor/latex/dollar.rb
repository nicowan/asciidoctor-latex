# a postprocessor to map the nonsense
# string 'DOLLOD' back to '$'
#
# This is used for the HTML backend
# in conjunction with the code
# in 'tex_preprocessor' which maps '\$' to
# 'DOLLOD'
#
# There should be a better solution to the
# vexing proble of dealing with both $ ... $
# for mathematics and '\$' for currency. But
# this works and wil have to do for now.
#
# @jirutka: Advice?
#
# module Asciidoctor::Latex
#   # Map DOLLOD to $
#   class Dollar < Asciidoctor::Extensions::Postprocessor
# 
#     def process document, output
#       output = output.gsub('DOLLOD', '$')
#     end
# 
#   end
# end
