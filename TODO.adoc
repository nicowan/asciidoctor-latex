== The todo list

* Manage the ID in all block or inline elements
* Unit testing for every node types
* Support for different kind of document type (book, article and beamer)


=== Manage the custom stylesheet

The idea is to create one tex file for each macro or environement.
The macro or env is defined in this files.
It is included at the end of the preamble when used in the document.
It is protected against double definition if already included in a custom preamble.
